Training Weather app with AngularJS
---------------------

This app will allow you to get 3, 5 or 7 days of weather forecasts from [OpenWeatherMap](//openweathermap.org/) API, for any city found in the API.

You can easily start a local server to run the project with: `http-server -o` if you have node.js http-server installed. If not, install first using npm: `npm install -g http-server`
